## Getting Started

Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of Heath Garvey, by the time you read this I'll already be dead.
No, not really, but by the time you do read this it'll be far too late for you to turn back. Or at the least
you'll get really bad whiplash. Not emergency ward whiplash, but bad enough whiplash that'll require a heat pack
and multiple appointments with that seedy physiotherapist with the 70's moustache who your friends have recommended
to you.

Yeah that one.

Good luck.

## Creator

The website has been designed and created by the legendary **Heath Garvey**, but if you find a bug you can
blame one of the many generous individuals from whom I've borrowed code. Of whom I'd like to thank:

* Gerta Xhepi for the website preloader http://codepen.io/xhepigerta/pen/PNQMVd.
* The Bootstrap team for the Bootstrap navbar.
* Alexer Erlandsson for the front page gradient http://codepen.io/alexerlandsson/.
